    # Iterate through the sentence; apply Pythonâ€™s .lower() method to lowercase the characters in the input sentence in order to standardize the input.
    for char in sentence.lower():

            # If the condition is met, then concatenate char to the letters_found string.
            letters_found += char
    # Return a boolean that compares the length of the letters_found string to the length of lowercase_letters, which contains all 26 letters a to z (i.e., 26).
